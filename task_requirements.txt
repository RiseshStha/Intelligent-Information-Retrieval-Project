Assessed Module Learning Outcomes 
The Learning Outcomes for this module align with the marking criteria which can be found at the end of 
this brief. Ensure you understand the marking criteria to ensure successful achievement of the 
assessment task. 
1. Demonstrate a sound knowledge of information retrieval principles.  
2. Apply main data structures used in index construction in Python or a similar high-level language.  
3. Implement a typical web crawler and query processor, in Python or similar high-level language.  
4. Acquire knowledge and skill to apply common machine learning methods for text classification and 
document clustering.  
5. Build the outline of a minimum viable vertical search engine for text retrieval.

Assignment Task 
There are two tasks in this coursework. You can use any general-purpose programming language of your 
choice to perform these tasks. However, Python is recommended. The tasks are specified next.  
 Task 1: Search Engine  
Create a vertical search engine comparable to Google Scholar, but specialized in retrieving just 
papers/books published by a member of Coventry University's Research Centre for Computational 
Science and Mathematical Modelling : https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/organisations/ics-research-
centre-for-computational-science-and-mathematical-mo  
 That is, at least one of the co-authors is a member of this department.  
Your system crawls the relevant web pages and retrieves information about all available publications. 
For each publication, it extracts available data (such as authors, publication year, and title) and the links 
to both the publication page and the author's profile (also called "pureportal" profile) page.  
 Make sure you that your crawler is polite, i.e., it preserves the robots.txt rules and does not hit the 
servers unnecessarily or too fast.  
 Because of low rate of changes to this information, your crawler may be scheduled to look for new 
information, say, once per week, but it should ideally be able to do so automatically, as a scheduled 
task. Every time it runs, it should update the index with the new data. Make sure you apply the required 
pre-processing tasks to both the crawled data and the users' queries.  
 From the user's perspective, your system provides an interface like Google Scholar's main page, where 
the user may enter in queries/keywords concerning the resources they wish to locate. The results will 
then be shown by your system, arranged by relevancy, in a manner like Google Scholar. However, the 
search results are limited to this department members' publications. Unless you aim to earn a score of 
70 or above, the user interface does not need to be web-based (like Google Scholar), and the usual 
Python interface in your IDE would do. However, for more usability, it would be preferable to be able to 
click on the printed links rather than copying and pasting them into a browser.  
Task 2: Document Classification (Naïve Bayes)

Collect and label documents that belong to different categories, namely Business, Entertainment and Health. Each document should be at least one sentence long. The total number of documents is up to you but should be at least 100 (more is better). You may collect documents from publicly available websites such as BBC News, ensuring you respect copyrights and cite sources appropriately. Manual collection is acceptable; writing a crawler is optional.

Train a supervised classifier using Multinomial Naïve Bayes with TF-IDF features to distinguish the categories. Use appropriate preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal or stemming as needed). Evaluate the model (accuracy, per-class precision/recall/F1) and save the trained model and evaluation metrics.

Finally, use the trained model to classify new unseen documents: the user inputs a document and the system outputs the predicted category and confidence score.

NOTE: Demonstrate robustness in your report and viva by testing varied inputs (short/long, with/without stopwords, mixed topics) and include screenshots or logs showing predictions.

Marking and Feedback 
How will my assignment be marked? 
Your assignment will be marked by the Module Team using standardized criteria. 
How will I receive grades and feedback? 
Provisional marks will be released once internally moderated. Feedback will be provided alongside 
grades release within 2 weeks (10 working days). 
What will I be marked against? 
Details of the marking criteria for this task can be found in the Assessment Marking Criteria section at 
the end of this brief.

Grade Requirements 
You must achieve 40% or above to pass this assessment. Ensure you understand the marking criteria for 
successful completion. 
Assignment Support and Academic Integrity 
Getting Help 
If you have any questions about this assignment, please meet your respective module leader or teacher 
for more information. 
Language Standards 
You are expected to use effective, accurate, and appropriate language within this assessment task. 
Academic Integrity 
The work you submit must be your own. All sources of information need to be acknowledged and 
attributed; therefore, you must provide references for all sources of information and acknowledge any 
tools used in the production of your work, excluding Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
We use detection software and make routine checks for evidence of academic misconduct. Definitions 
of academic misconduct, including plagiarism, self-plagiarism, and collusion can be found in Student 
handbook in Campus 4.0. 
All cases of suspected academic misconduct are referred to for investigation, the outcomes of which can 
have profound consequences to your studies. 
Support for Students with Disabilities 
If you have a disability, long-term health condition, specific learning difference, mental health diagnosis 
or symptoms, contact the Student Support Office for assistance. 
Unable to Submit on Time? 
If events prevent you from submitting on time, guidance on extenuating circumstances is available in 
the Student Handbook or from the Student Support Office.

Assessment Criteria 
Marking Requirement for each Task 
Requirements   Marks  
Fully working crawler component  
Must completely crawl the CU profile in google scholar and subsequent links in BFS manner. It 
should be scheduled to re-crawl to extract new data automatically.  
25  
Construction of Inverted Index  
Construction of the index based on appropriate data structures studied in the module as opposed 
to naïve database tables. The index should be updated once new data are received from the 
crawler component.  
15  
Fully working query processor component  
Displaying results relevant to given queries  
25  
Fully working document classification component  
A standard classification algorithm such as Naïve Bayes Classifier must be used. In addition, the 
learned model must be used to identify the right classification (e.g., Business, Health or Politics) 
for a given input. Various inputs must be used both in the report (via screenshots) and the viva to 
show that the system is accurate and robust.  
25  
Overall usability  
Acceptable response time, accuracy of results, nice interface, readable results sorted by 
relevance, subject grouping, and anything else that might affect the usability of the product.
