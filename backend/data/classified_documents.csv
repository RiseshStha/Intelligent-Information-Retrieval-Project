As a teenager in that country, she said she became part of a radical Jewish underground group for whom she acted as a spy and a saboteur, smuggling bombs and guns which they used against the British army who ran the country at the time and who they very much wanted to force out.  “I was a hero,” her mother would often boast, “never a victim.",Entertainment,The Guardian,she had a hidden identity new film uncovers a mother s second world war secrets in harrowing documentary my underground mother a woman finds out what really happened to her mother in the warwhen journalist marisa fox was a young girl her mother would regale her with stories of her own youth all of which roiled with drama and consequence when she was a year old girl living in poland in the late s on the brink of the nazi occupation her mother told her she was pulled away from her mother and put on a boat to palestine where she spent the rest of the second world war as a teenager in that country she said she became part of a radical jewish underground group for whom she acted as a spy and a saboteur smuggling bombs and guns which they used against the british army who ran the country at the time and who they very much wanted to force out i was a hero her mother would often boast never a victim,Entertainment

"The arrival of Two-Face in the new Batman sequel bodes well for a doom-laden moral epic.  Sebastian Stan is being eyed as district attorney Harvey Dent and his supervillain alter ego – can Gotham residents expect an improvement in the city’s patchy justice system?The arrival in Gotham City of Harvey Dent, AKA Two-Face, is rarely without consequence in Batman sagas.  Tommy Lee Jones’ shrieking, neon-splashed Batman Forever iteration turned the character into a dissociative identity slot machine, endlessly pulling its own lever, while Billy Dee Williams’ take in 1989’s Batman was a promise of future ruin.  In Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, the downfall of Aaron Eckhart’s crusading district attorney signalled the dangers of placing too much faith in the moral resilience of a single individual, especially in a city where the very idea of justice is already under existential strain.  With the news this week cautiously announced in the Hollywood Reporter that Sebastian Stan will be playing Dent in Matt Reeves’ highly anticipated forthcoming sequel to The Batman, it’s quite possible the new episode will be less interested in the masked theatrics of the 20th-century big screen caped crusader, and more in the idea that the very concept of justice is about to slowly disintegrate.",Entertainment,The Guardian,the arrival of two face in the new batman sequel bodes well for a doom laden moral epic sebastian stan is being eyed as district attorney harvey dent and his supervillain alter ego can gotham residents expect an improvement in the city s patchy justice system the arrival in gotham city of harvey dent aka two face is rarely without consequence in batman sagas tommy lee jones shrieking neon splashed batman forever iteration turned the character into a dissociative identity slot machine endlessly pulling its own lever while billy dee williams take in s batman was a promise of future ruin in christopher nolan s the dark knight the downfall of aaron eckhart s crusading district attorney signalled the dangers of placing too much faith in the moral resilience of a single individual especially in a city where the very idea of justice is already under existential strain with the news this week cautiously announced in the hollywood reporter that sebastian stan will be playing dent in matt reeves highly anticipated forthcoming sequel to the batman it s quite possible the new episode will be less interested in the masked theatrics of the th century big screen caped crusader and more in the idea that the very concept of justice is about to slowly disintegrate,Entertainment

"Bulk review – Ben Wheatley’s quirky sci-fi brings small-budget charm to big questions.  Wheatley’s engaging tale sends Sam Riley’s tough-guy reporter to the home of a reclusive oligarch who has invented a ‘Brain Collider’On a modest budget, director Ben Wheatley gives us a retro sci-fi with much tongue-in-cheek paranoia, questioning of reality and proliferation of multiverses, and featuring comic-book dialogue that’s been re-recorded, giving the whole thing a sheen of dreamlike unreality.  There’s also a lot of quirky lo-fi special effects work with Airfix models. Bulk is a movie indebted to a mountain of pop culture references listed in Wheatley’s own handwriting in block capitals over the closing credits.  Space: 1999 is one – it is good to see it there, and see it reflected in the preceding film – and with the monochrome cinematography, Dutch angles and looming closeups there’s a bit of John Frankenheimer and a little of Chris Petit.",Entertainment,The Guardian,bulk review ben wheatley s quirky sci fi brings small budget charm to big questions wheatley s engaging tale sends sam riley s tough guy reporter to the home of a reclusive oligarch who has invented a brain collider on a modest budget director ben wheatley gives us a retro sci fi with much tongue in cheek paranoia questioning of reality and proliferation of multiverses and featuring comic book dialogue that s been re recorded giving the whole thing a sheen of dreamlike unreality there s also a lot of quirky lo fi special effects work with airfix models bulk is a movie indebted to a mountain of pop culture references listed in wheatley s own handwriting in block capitals over the closing credits space is one it is good to see it there and see it reflected in the preceding film and with the monochrome cinematography dutch angles and looming closeups there s a bit of john frankenheimer and a little of chris petit,Entertainment

In recent years, diaspora artists such as Egyptian producer Abdullah Miniawy, singer Nadah El Shazly and Lebanese singer-songwriter Mayssa Jallad have each released records that combine the Arabic musical tradition of maqam and its slippery melodies with granular electronic sound design, rumbling bass and metallic drum programming to create a dramatic new proposition. Beirut-born and Amsterdam-based composer Toni Geitani is the latest to contribute to this growing scene with his masterfully produced second album Wahj (“radiance” in Arabic).  Working as a visual artist and sound designer, Geitani is well versed in creating imaginative soundscapes for films such as 2024 sci-fi Radius Collapse, as well as referencing the shadowy nocturnal hiss of producers such as Burial on his dabke-sampling 2018 debut album Al Roujoou Ilal Qamar.",Entertainment,The Guardian,toni geitani wahj review ammar kalia s global album of the month self released the beirut born producer s masterly second album revels in dark tension to cinematic effect finding beauty in ruinous soundarabic electronic experimentalism is thriving in recent years diaspora artists such as egyptian producer abdullah miniawy singer nadah el shazly and lebanese singer songwriter mayssa jallad have each released records that combine the arabic musical tradition of maqam and its slippery melodies with granular electronic sound design rumbling bass and metallic drum programming to create a dramatic new proposition beirut born and amsterdam based composer toni geitani is the latest to contribute to this growing scene with his masterfully produced second album wahj radiance in arabic working as a visual artist and sound designer geitani is well versed in creating imaginative soundscapes for films such as sci fi radius collapse as well as referencing the shadowy nocturnal hiss of producers such as burial on his dabke sampling debut album al roujoou ilal qamar,Entertainment
"Jenny on Holiday: Quicksand Heart review – Let’s Eat Grandma innovator’s knowing new-wave reinvention.  (Transgressive)In Jenny Hollingworth’s first solo venture, her singular songwriting powers shine in swooping vocals and transcendent pop melodiesOver the past decade, 27-year-old Jenny Hollingworth’s musical output has become steadily less strange.  As half of Let’s Eat Grandma, the Norwich native started out making freaky synth-folk the arch syrupiness of which chimed with the then-nascent hyperpop scene: I, Gemini, the duo’s 2016 debut, was outsiderish juvenilia of the most thrilling variety.  For its follow-up, I’m All Ears, Hollingworth and her bandmate, Rosa Walton, sharpened their songwriting skills while holding tight to their eccentricities; the result was an album of sensational futurist pop.  By 2022’s Two Ribbons, they were slipping into slightly more subdued, conventional territory – albeit retaining enough idiosyncratic sonic detailing to maintain their place at the edge.",Entertainment,The Guardian,jenny on holiday quicksand heart review let s eat grandma innovator s knowing new wave reinvention transgressive in jenny hollingworth s first solo venture her singular songwriting powers shine in swooping vocals and transcendent pop melodiesover the past decade year old jenny hollingworth s musical output has become steadily less strange as half of let s eat grandma the norwich native started out making freaky synth folk the arch syrupiness of which chimed with the then nascent hyperpop scene i gemini the duo s debut was outsiderish juvenilia of the most thrilling variety for its follow up i m all ears hollingworth and her bandmate rosa walton sharpened their songwriting skills while holding tight to their eccentricities the result was an album of sensational futurist pop by s two ribbons they were slipping into slightly more subdued conventional territory albeit retaining enough idiosyncratic sonic detailing to maintain their place at the edge,Entertainment
"Dry Cleaning: Secret Love review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week.  (4AD)The standout act in the sprechgesang wave, the four-piece’s newly expansive sound carries singer Florence Shaw’s distinctive tales of mundane lives spiralling out of controlDry Cleaning’s third album features a lot of strikingly odd lyrics.  Take your pick from “alien offshoot mushroom, going the gym to get slim”; “my dream house is a negative space of rock”; or, indeed, “when I was a child I wanted to be a horse, eating onions, carrots, celery”.  But it’s an ostensibly more straightforward line, from Cruise Ship Designer, that seems destined to attract the most attention.  “I make sure there are hidden messages in my work,” says vocalist Florence Shaw as the track draws to a conclusion, the muscular guitar riff that’s driven it along devolving into a janky, trebly scrabble.",Entertainment,The Guardian,dry cleaning secret love review alexis petridis s album of the week ad the standout act in the sprechgesang wave the four piece s newly expansive sound carries singer florence shaw s distinctive tales of mundane lives spiralling out of controldry cleaning s third album features a lot of strikingly odd lyrics take your pick from alien offshoot mushroom going the gym to get slim my dream house is a negative space of rock or indeed when i was a child i wanted to be a horse eating onions carrots celery but it s an ostensibly more straightforward line from cruise ship designer that seems destined to attract the most attention i make sure there are hidden messages in my work says vocalist florence shaw as the track draws to a conclusion the muscular guitar riff that s driven it along devolving into a janky trebly scrabble,Entertainment
